# Maak - A Solution for Cyber Violence

This project was developed by **Team Maak** as part of a hackathon at **ISIC School**. The primary goal of this initiative is to create a supportive and informative platform to combat cyber violence, with a special focus on providing resources and a safe space for victims.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app%5D\(https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app\)).

## About The Project

"Maak" (معاك), which means "With You" in Arabic, is a web application designed to offer a comprehensive support system for individuals facing cyber violence and online extortion. Our platform provides:

  * **Legal and Psychological Assistance**: We offer clear guidance on legal interventions and connect users with psychological support services to help them navigate the challenges of cyber violence.
  * **Community and Shared Experiences**: A safe space where users can read stories from others who have faced similar situations and, if they choose, share their own experiences to foster a sense of community and mutual support.
  * **Resource and News Hub**: We provide up-to-date news, articles, and a guide with actionable steps for victims of cyber violence.

## Our Team

  * **Mohamed Yassine Bassem**: Programmer
  * **Ilyas Lazreg**: Coordination and Finance Manager
  * **Amina Afnida**: Media and Communication Manager
